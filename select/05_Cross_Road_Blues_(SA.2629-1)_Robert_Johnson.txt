I went to the crossroad
Fell down on my knees
I went to the crossroad
Fell down on my knees
Asked the Lord above "Have mercy, now
Save poor Bob, if you please
Mmmmm, standin' at the crossroad
I tried to flag a ride
Standin' at the crossroad
I tried to flag a ride
Didn't nobody seem to know me
Everybody pass me by
Mmm, the sun goin' down, boy
Dark gon' catch me here
Oooo ooee eeee
Boy, dark gon' catch me here
I haven't got no lovin' sweet woman that
Love and feel my care
You can run, you can run
Tell my friend-boy Willie Brown
You can run, you can run
Tell my friend-boy Willie Brown
Lord, that I'm standin' at the crossroad, babe
I believe I'm sinkin' down
