Cross Road Blues

Saw my baby this morning,
We were standing at the crossroad of love.
Saw my baby this morning,
Standing at the crossroad of love.
She didn't wanna talk to me,
I know it was someone else she was thinking of.
I said baby, baby, baby, baby,
Would you please look around at me.
I said baby, baby, baby, baby,
Would you please look around at me.
You know you're the reason why
My heart sums so deep at misery.
I'm drifting and drifting
Like a ship way out in the sea.
I'm drifting and drifting
Like a ship way out in the sea.
I'm so hurt and feel bad, down and low,
For all the wrong you did to me.
Come on back now, baby.
Mama, please give me one more try.
Come on back, baby.
Please, get sit and give me one more try.
You know, you're the only one I love,
You can move these tears from my eyes.
