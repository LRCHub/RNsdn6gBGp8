I went down to the crossroads
Fell down on my knees.
Yes, down to the crossroads
Fell down on my knees.
Sweet Lord, I'm beggin' for mercy,
Won't you take me, if you please?
I went down to the crossroads
Tried to flag a ride
You tried that lately?
Down to the crossroads
Tried to flag a ride.
Nobody seemed to know me,
Everybody passed me by.

Well, I'm going down to Rosedale,
Take Loretta by my side
Yes, down to Rosedale,
Take Loretta by my side
Do you still have a house, baby
On the riverside?

Ahhhh, burn it up!

Going down to Rosedale,
Take Loretta by my side.
Yes, down to Rosedale,
Take Loretta by my side.
Do you still have a house, baby
On the riverside?
Ohhhh, I got something to believe in.
Stick it!
Yah.

You can run, you can run.
Tell all my friends, I'll be back.
We'll see y'all again, Atlanta.
Take it easy, huh!!!
You can run, you can run.
Tell my friends, I'll be back,
And I'll be standin' in the crossroads
I believe I'm sinkin' down.
